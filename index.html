    <h1>Varshini Guduru - on a quest to settle in to the United States</h1>
    <h5>Tennessee State University</h5>
    <p>Varshini Guduru, an Indian national, from Muffakham Jah College of Engineering & Technology (MJCET). I would instead settle in the USA by moving to the United States first on an F-1 Visa and later move on to an H-1B through an OPT.</p>
    
<br /><p>
      Varshini Guduru, has mentioned that the F-1 visa is easy to get. She has been reported allegedly involved in practicing plagiarism and has mentioned that she is getting her documents drafted through multiple Indian consultancies. She also believes that the admissions process is a almost a sham. She would never pay the application fee and would instead persuade the universities to offer her application fee waivers.<br><br>

      <p>When asked about how Guduru aims to deal with her visa interview, she mentions that the visa interview in itself is the greatest sham. It is relatively easy to lie during the interview process and the visa officers approve or reject the visa based on how well one can lie during the interview. She mentions that
          she will be lying on her visa interview to mention that she aims at coming back to India and continuing her job at Extarc Software Solutions. While the US Embassy is yet to be notified of this applicant, Guduru seems to have a casual attitude towards the visa interview process in general.
  </p>
      <p>Guduru was rejected under the 214(b) category at her recent interview in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Her sole intent was to make it to the US and she found an easier way out by entering the US through Sri Lankan consulates. </p>

      <p>“Varshini Guduru is said to have plans of studying overseas in the USA and was hoping to lie on her applications.”, said Ajay Gupta, her colleague at MJCET.
</p>
      <p>The details of the case help us understand how Indian students are in violation of the overall study abroad process and choose to take it lightly.
      The authorities are yet to be notified of these endeavors.</p>
